# Survey-Form-Project
This is a project that was required to complete the HTML/CSS course on codecamp. 
it was optional but i thought it was very fun as well, this type of project i feel would be one of the most used from what ive seen;
I feel this was one of the most useful projects that i have done so far.
This was done on codepen so it might look off here but i thought this should be included just in case. 
you can look at how the page looks by going to my codepen page to see it in action. https://codepen.io/cluna2305/pen/gOpeyBK
